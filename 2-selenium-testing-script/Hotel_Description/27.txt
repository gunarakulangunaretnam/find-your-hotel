We were very happy to spend 3 nights at this resort from 8-10 April.||The staff were all very pleasant, helpful and engaging.|| The range of food was extensive, and suitable for our requirements.||We have been thinking of you all since the terrible events of Easter Sunday, and hope that peace and harmony return to your people
