Warm and welcoming hospitality shown by a lovely team. Spent one night here at the start of our Sri Lankan adventure. ||Highly recommend dinner @ the rock! The scenery is stunning and worth the small hike. A very unique experience, the food served is tasty. ||Comfortable, clean and unique stay! Very peaceful! ||||
