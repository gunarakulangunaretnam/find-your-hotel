Very helpful staff, nice quiet place to relax after walking up Sigiriya. Excellent food, try the curry and rice for dinner, its amazing and only 700 rupee. Nice sunset over the lake. Also keep an eye out for the fireflies at night. Its a little far out so you will have to tuk tuk everywhere. The hotel doesnt have bikes to rent.
